# App-Automation-on-EMI-calculator-with-Selenium-Appium

An EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator is a tool used to calculate the monthly payments that need to be made towards a loan.

## Project scenerio:

**If an user take loan (?) tk from a bank with interest of (?)% and  want to give (?) tk per month as EMI (installment) and processing fee (?)%, how many time period it will take to complete the loan? Take the values from dataset and assert the monthly EMI, total interest, processing fee amount and total payment from the result view.**

**For solve this question, create a dataset using following values:**

```
Amount | Interest | EMI | Processing Fee | Monthly EMI | Total Interest | Processing Fee | Total Payment | Period (Year) | Period (Month)

100000 | 6 | 2000 | 2% | 2000 | 15361.08 | 2000 | 115361.08 | 4 | 10
200000 | 8 | 5000 | 2% | 5000 | 33391.61 | 4000 | 233391.61 | 3 | 11

250000 | 7 | 8000 | 1.5% | 8000 | 26804.51 | 3750 | 276804.51 | 2 | 11

50000 | 10 | 1000 | 5% | 1000 | 14949.12 | 2500 | 64949.12 | 5 | 5
